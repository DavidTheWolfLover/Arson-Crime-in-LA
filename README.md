## Introduction

This is a final project for data modeling course that compares two population proportions to assess the relationship between the **weapon involved in arson crimes** (in billions of people) and the **time of day**. We will seek answers through data analysis, drawing graphs, and conducting hypothesis testing to see which time of day arson crime is likely to be weapon-involved.

## Research Question

For all “arson” crimes, is it significantly more likely for a weapon to be involved in the late evening compared to the early morning?

## Hypothesis

- The null hypothesis is that the difference between the two weapon presence proportions (late evening & early morning) is 0.
- 
- The alternate hypothesis is that the weapon presence proportion during the late evening is larger than the weapon presence proportion during the day.
